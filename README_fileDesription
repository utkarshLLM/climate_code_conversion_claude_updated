main.py is the main control block. It calls the functions from generate.py. It also tell the code to run tests.
generate.py has all the functions to generate 1. python translation, 2. unit tests
messages.py has all the prompts for the LLM
RAG is the file that calls all the RAG functionalities: chunk_code, Embedding.
testing.py runs the unit tests on the docker and some other functionalities.
utils.py has miscellaneous functions
debug.py (still not totally complete) has some functionalities that tells the LLM to debug the generated Python translation
continuation.py contains the file that we used for Iterative Translation
continuation_flagpoint.py; main_.py; messages_flagpoint.py are mostly experimental file and not important
Best_translation_micro_mg_tend.py is the best translation we got and then the daily token limit of Claude got exhausted
Rest other files are either some code files necessary like the requirements.txt for the project or some code files that were generated or maybe just are there for convenience's sake.
